# Chess-Project

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to predict with reasonable accuracy the outcome of a chess game given n moves.

## Method
This project uses a class, "ChessGame", that takes in input a vector of moves in traditional chess notation, intitializes a chess board as a dataframe, and plays every move in the virtual chess board. After the moves are completed, the class analyzes the output chessboard to derive some features from it, in order to predict the game result.
